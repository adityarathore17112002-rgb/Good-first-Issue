## 📚 Detailed Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1️⃣: Fork This Repository

**What is forking?** Creating your own copy of this project in your GitHub account.

1. Click the **"Fork"** button at the top-right of this page
2. Wait a few seconds while GitHub creates your copy

![Fork Button Location](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-40742/mw-1440/images/help/repository/fork-button.webp)

✅ **Success Check:** You should now be on `github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Good-first-Issue`

---

### Step 2️⃣: Clone Your Fork

**What is cloning?** Downloading the code to your computer so you can edit it.

1. On **your forked repository**, click the green **"Code"** button
2. Copy the URL (should look like: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Good-first-Issue.git`)
3. Open your terminal/command prompt
4. Navigate to where you want to save the project (e.g., Desktop):
   ```bash
   cd Desktop
   ```
5. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Good-first-Issue.git
   ```
6. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Good-first-Issue
   ```

✅ **Success Check:** Run `ls` (Mac/Linux) or `dir` (Windows). You should see files like README.md

---

### Step 3️⃣: Create a New Branch

**What is a branch?** A separate version of the code where you can make changes safely.

```bash
git checkout -b add-your-name
```

**Pro Tip:** Replace `your-name` with your actual name (e.g., `add-john-doe`)

✅ **Success Check:** You should see: `Switched to a new branch 'add-your-name'`

---

### Step 4️⃣: Add Your Name

1. Open `README.md` in your text editor
2. Scroll down to the **"👥 Contributors"** section
3. Add your name following this **exact format**:
   ```markdown
   - [Aditya Singh Rathore](https://github.com/Adez017)
   ```
   
**Example:**
```markdown
- [John Doe](https://github.com/johndoe)
```

4. **Save the file** (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)

⚠️ **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Don't forget the `-` at the start
- Don't forget the square brackets `[]` around your name
- Don't forget the parentheses `()` around your GitHub URL
- Make sure the URL is YOUR GitHub profile (replace YOUR-USERNAME)

---

### Step 5️⃣: Commit Your Changes

**What is a commit?** Saving your changes with a description of what you did.

1. Check what you changed:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   You should see `README.md` listed in red.

2. Stage your changes:
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   ```

3. Commit with a message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add [Your Name] to contributors list"
   ```
   **Example:** `git commit -m "Add John Doe to contributors list"`

✅ **Success Check:** You should see a message like `1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)`

---

### Step 6️⃣: Push to GitHub

**What is pushing?** Uploading your changes from your computer back to GitHub.

```bash
git push origin add-your-name
```

Remember to use the branch name you created in Step 3!

✅ **Success Check:** You should see `Branch 'add-your-name' set up to track remote branch`

---

### Step 7️⃣: Create a Pull Request

**What is a Pull Request (PR)?** Asking the project maintainer to review and accept your changes.

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub (`github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Good-first-Issue`)
2. You should see a yellow banner saying **"Compare & pull request"** - click it!
3. Add a title: `Add [Your Name] to contributors`
4. Add a description (optional but nice):
   ```
   Hi! This is my first contribution to open source. 
   I've added my name to the contributors list. 
   Thank you for this beginner-friendly project! 🎉
   ```
5. Click **"Create pull request"**

✅ **Success Check:** You should see your PR with a number (e.g., #42)

---
